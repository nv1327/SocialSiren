# SocialSiren
A social distancing tool that alerts the app user whether they're in proximity of a sick person. Created using geolocation in Flutter, which livestreams GPS data to a Node.js server that uploads to MongoDB Atlas. It is a powerful application because it has the ability to instantly go cross-platform and everything is stored/backed up in the cloud.

## Tools used:
- REST API with Node.js / Express
- Flutter
- MongoDB Atlas
- Figma


## Applications:
- To improve social distancing measures
- Provide awareness for disease spread
- User IDs are kept completely anonymous to prevent doxing/ostracision


## Improvements for the future:
- Improve the Node.js Schema model to only PATCH/PUT the longitude and latitude rather than the entire user schema.
- Improve anonymity measures and use further encryption like bcryptjs if needed
